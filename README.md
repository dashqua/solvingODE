# solvingODE
A Fortran based program which computes numerically a physical phenomenon described with an equation.
Just ask for the relation with math.

This is an occasion to practice Fortran 90 . The code can help to get used to the F90 statements (use module, allocation, data structure,...) and the features of a makefile. Feel free, to copy or get inspired by my code.
Plus, I didn't feel the need to organize my files into several directories because I assume the few files are self-explanatory.
